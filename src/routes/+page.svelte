	// I need some sort of overall game state. Is game in progress? Is it over? Did user win or lose?
	// I need the current word (word-to-guess) obviously.
	// I need to store the word entered by user, so that I can compare it to the word.
	// I need to store number of attempts, so that game is finished either when the word is guessed correctly or 6 attempts ran out
	// I need to store previously entered words as well so that I can display them and prevent user from entering the same word
	// I have no idea how to test whether the letter is in a wrong place :( and what if there are 2 same letters in the wordâ€¦

<!--
User interface

- It's a 5x6 grid.
- Upon user input, entered word is separated into letters and mapped to the 5 squares in the current row.
- The letters are then colored either gray, green, or yellow.
- A text input at the bottom
- (or potentially a visual keyboard for v2)
